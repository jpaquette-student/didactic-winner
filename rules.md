# X-Team 59 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
First, assign tasks via volunteering for them and then if there are still tasks the 
group leader will ask specific members if they are able to complete the task.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will have a form where each member logs the progress on their tasks as well as
we will verbally/via text update each other on the progress of our assigned tasks.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will speak/text the group about troubles we are having. If there are no group
members able to help we will then consult outside sources.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will set progress goals so that way each task should be completed. Also, if 
a group member were suddenly unable to complete their task, another group member
would be able to step in without having to do the whole task.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Just communicate well and work together.
